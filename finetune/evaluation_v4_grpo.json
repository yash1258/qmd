Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### 1. **Install the Redis Module**\nFirst, install the `redis` package using npm:\n```bash\nnpm install redis --save\n```\n\n### 2. **Set Up Redis Connection**\nYou need to establish a connection to Redis. You can do this by creating a Redis client instance. Below is a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Redis } = require('redis');\n\n// Connect to Redis\nconst redis = Redis.createClient({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  port: 6379,\n  database: 0, // Default database\n});\n\n// Set a value in Redis\nredis.set('key1', 'value1', (err) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Error setting Redis value:', err);\n  } else {\n    console.log('Value",
