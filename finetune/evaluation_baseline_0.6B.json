Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I should check if there are any known typos or errors in the original query. The user wrote \"typescript async await\", but maybe they meant something else? For example, maybe they meant \"typescript async await\" but there's a typo like \"typescript async await\" or \"typescript async await\". Alternatively, maybe they meant \"typescript async await\" which is a valid syntax for asynchronous functions in TypeScript. \n\nWait, the original query is exactly \"typescript async await\", so maybe there's a formatting issue? Let me check the syntax again. The user included the code block with the query inside. So the query is \"typescript async await\" and then the code block. \n\nSo expanding the search would mean that the user is looking for results related to TypeScript, async/await, and the code block.",

Rebase is when you apply changes from a branch to another, and merge is when you combine branches into one. The difference is that rebase changes the history, while merge keeps the original history.\n\nNow, the table needs to have columns",
